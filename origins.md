# Where do the “Mango Heroes” come from?
>> The Mango Heroes Origin Story
>> Every hero has an origin story, right? Of course!

But in truth the Mango “Heroes” weren’t all “heroes” and they haven’t all taken the same path. Maybe this will make more sense if we take a step back a bit and take a closer look at their mysterious origins.

The Mango Heroes as you know them actually come from an island far, far away called Zìyóu (loosely translated as Freedom).

Mango Island or also Known as Zìyóu (loosely translated as Freedom)

This island became the home world for a cosmic being from outer space. Dasheri was stranded, lonely, and her intrinsic magic was fleeting. With the last bit of her power, she imbued the island with her magic and from that a tree grew.

Dasheri’s children were unique beings in themselves that adopted certain characteristics from the island fruit trees but also certain characteristics from their mother. Their level of intelligence grew so rapidly that eventually they became bored with their home land and yearned for something more.

For the next adventure.

Maybe this is the pull of all “heroes”?

It was this pull, this pulse, to do something more that drove her children away from her. You see, Dasheri created the mangos out of loneliness and it saddened her that they yearned to leave her but both art, and life, have an interesting way of growing in ways we do not expect.

So, they went off on their own paths.

Crashing into our world the mangos fell in love with the culture thru any books they could find. The first of those, and seemingly their favorite, were comics.


The magic that created them morphed, developed, and manifested itself through their own imaginations in ways that Dasheri never realized it would.

And such the first of the Mango “Heroes” were The Comics after the comics they learned from and imitated. The Mango Heroes’ telekinesis materialized as more specific powers that were unique to each of them. These included flight, strength, durability, and more.
